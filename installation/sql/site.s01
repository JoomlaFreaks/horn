If we cancel any of your Paid Subscriptions or modify the Channel Name of your Paid Channel for any reason other than for a violation of these Terms, we will issue you a pro-rata refund for the remaining, unused portion of your Paid Subscription, which will be your sole and exclusive remedy in the event of such cancellation or termination.</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><strong>Channel Owners and Operators.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><strong>            10.1.  Definitions.</strong>  As used in these Terms:</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><strong>                        10.1.1.  </strong>\"<em>Paid Channel</em>\" means either a Horn Channel for which a Channel Owner (as defined below) has purchased a Paid Subscription or a Horn Channel owned by 8eo.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><strong>                        10.1.2.  </strong>\"<em>Free Channel</em>\" means any Horn Channel other than a Paid Channel.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><strong>                        10.1.3.  </strong>\"<em>Channel Owner</em>\" means a Horn User who has purchased a subscription to a Paid Channel.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><strong>                        10.1.4.  </strong>\"<em>Channel Operator</em>\" means a Horn User who has the permission and ability to perform certain administrative functions with respect to the applicable Horn Channel.

(The AAA\'s rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at <a href=\"http://www.adr.org/\">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1.800.778.7879.) The arbitrator(s) will have the power to rule on any challenge to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator(s) or to the validity or enforceability of any portion of the agreement to arbitrate. Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator, unless the claim amount exceeds $1 Million United States Dollars, in which case the dispute shall be heard by a panel of three arbitrators. In arbitrations having one arbitrator, the arbitrator will be selected by the AAA. In arbitrations with three arbitrators, within fifteen (15) days after the commencement of arbitration, each party shall select one person to act as arbitrator and the two selected shall select a third arbitrator within ten days of their appointment. If the arbitrators selected by the parties are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA. The place of arbitration shall be Charlottesville, Virginia, United States, and the arbitration shall be conducted in English. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the applicable federal laws of the United States. The arbitrator(s) will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party\'s actual damages, except as may be required by applicable laws. The arbitrator(s) may award injunctive relief for infringement of Intellectual Property Rights or any violation of the Acceptable Use Policy. The arbitrator(s) shall not award consequential, punitive, special, or exemplary damages in any arbitration initiated under this Section 17.2. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) and an equal share of the arbitrators\' and administrative fees of arbitration.

Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties, except that that the parties may disclose such information to the extent required by law and to their respective agents and professional advisors who have a legitimate need to know such information. The Underlying Award may be appealed pursuant to the AAA\'s Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules (\"<em>Appellate Rules</em>\"), and the Underlying Award shall not be considered final until after the time for filing the notice of appeal pursuant to the Appellate Rules has expired. Appeals must be initiated within thirty (30) days of receipt of an Underlying Award, as defined by Rule A-3 of the Appellate Rules, by filing a Notice of Appeal with any AAA office.

If the arbitrator(s) or any court determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then Section 17.2 will not apply and will not be considered a part of these Terms and the parties shall be deemed not to have agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\">            <strong>17.4.  Right to Opt Out.</strong>  You have the right to opt out of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions in Sections 17.2 and 17.3 by completing, signing, and mailing the Opt Out Form located <a href=\"https://horn.co/legal.html#OON\">here</a> within sixty (60) days after the date you first began using the Service.

The purpose of trademark law is to prevent consumers from being confused about who provides or is affiliated with a product or service. The owner of a trademark has the right to prevent others from using its trademarks (or similar trademarks) in a way that is likely to confuse people into thinking that the person using the trademark is the trademark owner or has a relationship with the trademark owner or that the trademark owner approves or endorses the other person\'s products or services.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><strong>                        2.2.2.  Using Trademarks.  </strong>Your Horn Handle and the Channel Names and Channel Logos you create or control must not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Use any of the 8eo trademarks or copyrighted materials (including the names 8eo and Horn and the associated logos) except as expressly permitted by the Terms or with our prior written permission;</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Impersonate or attempt to impersonate any of the 8eo Parties or our employees;</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Use the name of another person, organization, or brand with the intent to impersonate that person, organization, or brand;</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Use anyone else\'s trademarks in any way that is likely to cause confusion about your relationship with the owner of the trademark or gives the impression that the owner of the trademark approves or endorses you, your User Content, or your Horn Chanel; or</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Be offensive, vulgar, or obscene.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\">We reserve the right to refuse registration of, or to cancel, remove, or change, any Horn Handle, Channel Name, or Channel Logo in our sole discretion.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><strong>            2.3.  Copyrights.</strong>  Copyright law protects original works of authorship (such as drawings, photos, music, books, and audiobooks).

You and 8eo agree to work in good faith to settle any dispute, claim, controversy, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, which is a prerequisite to either you or 8eo initiating arbitration or a lawsuit.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 300;\\\">\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0<strong>17.2.\\u00a0\\u00a0Agreement to Binding Arbitration.<\\/strong>\\u00a0\\u00a0If you and 8eo do not reach a mutually agreed resolution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is first pursued pursuant to Section\\u00a017.1, then either you or 8eo may initiate binding arbitration. Any controversy, dispute, or claim arising out of or relating to (a)\\u00a0these Terms (including, but not limited to, the interpretation and scope of the arbitration provisions in this Section\\u00a017.2 and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, or claim), (b)\\u00a0the formation, performance, or breach of these Terms, or (c)\\u00a0alleged infringement by 8eo or the Service of any Intellectual Property Rights, shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the \\\"<em>AAA<\\/em>\\\") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. (The AAA\'s rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at\\u00a0<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.adr.org\\/\\\">www.adr.org<\\/a>\\u00a0or by calling the AAA at 1.800.778.7879.) The arbitrator(s) will have the power to rule on any challenge to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator(s) or to the validity or enforceability of any portion of the agreement to arbitrate. Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator, unless the claim amount exceeds $1 Million United States Dollars, in which case the dispute shall be heard by a panel of three arbitrators. In arbitrations having one arbitrator, the arbitrator will be selected by the AAA. In arbitrations with three arbitrators, within fifteen (15) days after the commencement of arbitration, each party shall select one person to act as arbitrator and the two selected shall select a third arbitrator within ten days of their appointment. If the arbitrators selected by the parties are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA. The place of arbitration shall be Charlottesville, Virginia, United States, and the arbitration shall be conducted in English. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the applicable federal laws of the United States. The arbitrator(s) will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party\'s actual damages, except as may be required by applicable laws. The arbitrator(s) may award injunctive relief for infringement of Intellectual Property Rights or any violation of the Acceptable Use Policy. The arbitrator(s) shall not award consequential, punitive, special, or exemplary damages in any arbitration initiated under this Section\\u00a017.2. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) and an equal share of the arbitrators\' and administrative fees of arbitration. The award of the arbitrator(s) (the \\\"<em>Underlying Award<\\/em>\\\") shall be accompanied by a reasoned opinion. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties, except that that the parties may disclose such information to the extent required by law and to their respective agents and professional advisors who have a legitimate need to know such information. The Underlying Award may be appealed pursuant to the AAA\'s Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules (\\\"<em>Appellate Rules<\\/em>\\\"), and the Underlying Award shall not be considered final until after the time for filing the notice of appeal pursuant to the Appellate Rules has expired. Appeals must be initiated within thirty (30) days of receipt of an Underlying Award, as defined by Rule A-3 of the Appellate Rules, by filing a Notice of Appeal with any AAA office. Following the appeal process, the decision rendered by the appeal tribunal may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 300;\\\">\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0<strong>17.3.\\u00a0\\u00a0Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver.<\\/strong>\\u00a0\\u00a0You and 8eo further agree that any lawsuit or arbitration shall be conducted in your (including, if applicable, Your Company\'s) and 8eo\'s individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and you and 8eo expressly waive the right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.

Unfortunately, some conferencing systems, like join.me, use the same online meeting room for every one of your meetings - so once someone has been to one of your video conferences, web meeting or conference call, they know your meeting room address. This may be fine if you are manually \"allowing\" each attendee in one at a time - but if you have 20 invited guests, you might be tempted to just \"unlock\" the meeting - and there goes your control. If you have different back-to-back sessions planned, how ugly could it be if you are VP of HR rolling out the benefits to different groups of workers - exempt staff at 1pm and the unionized staff at 2pm - and someone dials in at the wrong time? You also won\'t have any way of knowing who actually attended. Without the lock on the meeting, the attendees aren\'t logged into the system in any tangible way. With horn, you can easily host a secure session where only those with invitations can access - and your next session can be in a separate \"meeting room\" that you can switch into with just a couple of clicks.</li><li>Controlling who is seen and heard. Having a video conference with many attendees and multiple presenters in disparate locations - potentially even across the globe - requires technology that can support you in identifying who is who - and giving each group specific rights. Say you want your presenters to be able to speak and be seen via video at all times, broadcasting the presentation to the audience. The audience should be able to see and hear, but not chime in to ask questions until you open up the floor for audio. Zoom\'s webinar meetings can do this - but it is separately licensed and priced (higher) than their standard meeting software.</li><li>All your video conferencing needs - and more. Many organizations have an array of technology licenses to address their various online meeting, voice conferencing and broadcasting needs. It\'s not unusual to see the see one paying for join.me, Zoom, and GoToWebinar at the same time - wracking up lots of cost and still having unhappy users. Having a flexible system like horn, you can use whether you\'re holding a video conference for 10 or 100 - and can also leverage for your other web and voice meeting needs. This can run the gamut from live and recorded broadcasts to using in your tech support or customer service calls to internal project meetings. One platform that meets wider needs lets your team be comfortable with a single, feature rich tech - and is a much more cost-effective and flexible approach for most businesses.</li><li>Continuing to enhance and reflect your brand. It\'s nice when you can have your internal folks using a video conferencing system that reflects your brand\'s usual \"look and feel.\" It\'s imperative for prospective and current clients that your brand moves seamlessly through all your embedded technology for interactions and communications, including video conferencing platform. So ask about \"white labelling\" and customizing the interface for your organization with any potential provider.</li></ul></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"heading\" ><h2>The best video conferencing tech can\'t help unless…</h2></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"text\" ><p>Great tech is a huge part of a successful presentation delivered via video conferencing - it\'s not the only thing.

And are you looking right into the camera on your screen - or are they looking at the top of your head as you look down at your notes on the desk while you mumble? You want to be looking directly into the camera, speaking clearly - loud enough but not shouting - and have a neutral environment.</li><li>Panel preparation. Share with your other presenters the \"tips and tricks\" that you are employing for ensuring a good location for the video conference - quiet, good visuals etc. Provide them with the agenda/flow of events you\'ve planned and confirm that everyone is on the same page. You\'ll also want to invite to be presenters and share specific instructions for accessing the video conferencing system.</li><li>Tech practice. Practice launching the different stages of the video conference with one or more of the other presenters (it\'s great when all can do a \"dress rehearsal\' but not always practical or possible).

Having a consistent schedule for rolling out your earnings report and call helps neutralize the guessing game of analysts or media play about whether your numbers are going to meet expectations. If you do it at different times each quarter, you may inadvertently be broadcasting in advance your results. On good quarters, you may want to release numbers sooner and earlier in the week. For tougher quarters, later and on Thursday. Even if you aren\'t that blatant, your scheduling pattern may reveal more than you think. This consistency also simplifies it for your internal team for logistics and planning. </li><li>Have a consistent time in advance of the call to announce. Having a consistent time each quarter for your call is one thing - announcing the date of that call is the other element that should be consistent. Most companies do it somewhere between one and three weeks before the call. Pick your standard - and incorporate into your IR annual plan so that it doesn\'t creep up on you. Again, the more consistent these types of elements, the less likely they are to inadvertently color expectations.</li><li>Utilize social media and other digital pathways to spread the news. Your next generation of potential investors may or may not visit your website in time to see the announcement - and may never see a press release.

You may want to record the meeting. Be sure you let your invitees know of your intention to record in the initial invitation and in the agenda. Remind your participants at the kick-off of the meeting that you will be recording for others to experience later - and do this before you turn on the recording.

Preparation of materials</h2></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"text\" ><p>​You are calling this meeting to accomplish specific goals. Prepare an overview presentation and materials to illustrate your concepts and to inform the participants. Keep it relevant to the goals and topic. Plan ahead with questions to invoke your attendees to engage in the conversation. Determine if/how you or another attendee will jot notes about the conversation and decisions made - and make them visible for the attendees. If you work in an open concept office, identify and appropriate space to conduct the meeting and schedule it in advance. </p></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"heading\" ><h2>\n	<span>5. Conducting the actual online&nbsp;meeting<span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\">​</span></span>\n</h2></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"text\" ><p>You\'ll want to get ready early for your meeting. Be sure the space where you will be is quiet and clean (especially if you are using the video conferencing/web camera and your attendees can see you and your space.) Have only those things open on your computer that you need - the conferencing system, the specific materials you will be sharing and/or referencing; etc. - and that things you don\'t need, like chat or system notifications are turned off completely. Initiate your actual online meeting a few minutes early. This will allow you test your audio settings/volume to insure your attendees can hear you, but not feel shouted at. You\'ll have time to queue up any elements (like a powerpoint presentation) and note taking screen. This also gives your attendees who might need a little help an opportunity to have you walk through using the system. Start your meeting with a quick round of introductions, if this is not a team that has worked together before or there are new members in the mix. Remind everyone that occasionally there may be a slight delay in what they are seeing or hearing - so be sure to not rush through. Take a breath between thoughts and don\'t get too frenetic with clicking between visual materials. To close the meeting, thank everyone and confirm decisions and any next steps.</p></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"heading\" ><h2>\n	<span><p>6.

After your meeting, research any questions that arose and weren\'t answered during the meeting. Compile your note plus the identified next steps - including who is responsible with deadlines - and send out to all the invitees. Include the recording, if applicable. This is also your opportunity to survey or ask a couple of questions about what they thought worked well and/or what could be better next time. You want your meetings to always meet - or exceed - expectations, and we should all look to make each meeting worth the time spent.</p></div>', NULL, '1', '1', '0', '2018-02-19 18:54:55', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0', '0', '5', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, 'post:6/successful-meetings.jpg', '{\"images\":[],\"videos\":[],\"audios\":[],\"galleries\":[],\"pdf\":[]}', '', '0', '0', '15', '0', 'easyblog.sitewide', '67.165.173.183', 'ebd', '{\"type\":\"ebd\",\"blocks\":[{\"uid\":\"09969555114231397\",\"type\":\"text\",\"html\":\"\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>If you were inviting a group of people to your office for a face-to-face meeting, you would do certain things to make sure that it was successful.

We started using Horn, and week by week, new features were being released that were revolutionizing how people meet online.

In terms of other products, our company has simply used them all: WebEx, GoToMeeting, Fuze, UberConference, Join.me, AnyMeeting, Google Hangouts, Skype, Zoom, and the list could go on and on.</span></p>\n<p>For the sake of this article, we\'ll focus on three formidable solutions - Zoom, Skype and Horn - and why Horn supersedes them all, especially in 4 main areas:</p>\n<ol><li>Brand Continuity</li><li>Ease of Use</li><li>Quality</li><li>Moderation</li></ol></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"heading\" ><h3>Zoom vs. Skype vs. Horn: Brand Continuity</h3></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"text\" ><p><span>Organizations spend big bucks to ensure their brand is consistent. Everything from how they talk about themselves to visual identify must be carefully and strategically aligned.

It\'s a feature that all web conferencing platforms should have, and it\'s a hindrance to any company not fully taking advantage of this. From a business owner\'s perspective, it\'s so important to get quality leads in the door, so having the ability to manage the entire end-to-end experience from the point of lead inception to the initial sales call is imperative. Horn makes this happen.</p></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"heading\" ><h3><p>Zoom vs. Skype vs. Horn: Ease</p></h3></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"text\" ><p>​<span>We\'re all dealing with a loaded technology stack with differing levels of complexity and learning curves. Both presenters and attendees should be able to quickly get started without any downloads, and continue the conference on a zero-learning curve.</span></p>\n<p>Zoom is powerful, but has suffered from feature-bloat throughout the years. You can start a meeting from multiple sources: Google Calendar; from their app; from the Zoom site; and, it can be extremely confusing for someone to keep track of everything they offer. At the end of the day, all I want to do is quickly setup a meeting and have it happen mellifluously and smoothly.</p>\n<p>With Horn, no downloads are necessary; saving time, resources, and therefore, money. </p>\n<p>Skype requires a download, and with it\'s ever-changing navigation, people are confused on what does what. </p>\n<p>Easy. Simple. No fuss.

We went through the exercise of each people muting their audio to determine the culprit, and precious meeting minutes were lost and people were frustrated.</p><p>So we ended up switching to Skype, and similar issues ensued. With Horn, the audio quality is impeccable. Take it for a test drive yourself, and see. (link to demo).</p><p>In some large meetings such as earnings release calls (link to article), poor audio quality could end up in next day\'s headlines. Investing in top-notch quality is an absolute must.</p></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"heading\" ><h3><p>Zoom vs. Skype vs. Horn: Moderation</p></h3></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"text\" ><p>In the above scenario that was generated by poor audio quality, it would have been invaluable to know who the \'bad audio bandit\' was so we could mute them. This brings us to moderation. How can we mute an attendee if their audio is diminishing the overall quality of the meeting? How can we quickly assign certain privileges such as screen sharing or \'presenter roles\' on the fly and on a whim?</p><p>While Skype\'s moderation tools are lacking, Zoom\'s tools are frankly quite powerful. However, if they aren\'t easy and/ or accessible to the user, then it\'s a bit for naught. Horn makes it intuitive and easy to use their most powerful functions.</p></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"heading\" ><h3><p>So what\'s next?</p></h3></div><div class=\"ebd-block  \" data-type=\"text\" ><p>​<span>Communication is everything.
