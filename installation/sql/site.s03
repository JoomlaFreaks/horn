In that announcement you\'ll include not only time and date, but the call-in info for the actual earnings release&nbsp;call. Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD) requires you announce the information to everyone at the same time - and yes, posting the announcement to your website meets that requirement. On the other hand, the SEC\'s Exchange Act Form 8-K requires a press release - so yes, you\'ll want to do that too. <\\/p>\\n<p>But what about other methods, like posting to social media or email blasts to your contact list? And when should you announce? These are more flexible and your decisions should be made in light of your overall IR strategy. Some ideas\\/recommendations:<\\/p>\\n<ul><li>Plan to release at same time of quarter\\/day of week. Having a consistent schedule for rolling out your earnings report and call helps neutralize the guessing game of analysts or media play about whether your numbers are going to meet expectations. If you do it at different times each quarter, you may inadvertently be broadcasting in advance your results. On good quarters, you may want to release numbers sooner and earlier in the week. For tougher quarters, later and on Thursday. Even if you aren\'t that blatant, your scheduling pattern may reveal more than you think. This consistency also simplifies it for your internal team for logistics and planning. <\\/li><li>Have a consistent time in advance of the call to announce. Having a consistent time each quarter for your call is one thing - announcing the date of that call is the other element that should be consistent. Most companies do it somewhere between one and three weeks before the call. Pick your standard - and incorporate into your IR annual plan so that it doesn\'t creep up on you. Again, the more consistent these types of elements, the less likely they are to inadvertently color expectations.<\\/li><li>Utilize social media and other digital pathways to spread the news. Your next generation of potential investors may or may not visit your website in time to see the announcement - and may never see a press release. Concurrently announcing via social media - along with your required pathways - can help enhance the awareness in your future investors where they spend the most time online.<\\/li><\\/ul><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"heading\\\" ><h2>Utilize an earnings call system you control<\\/h2><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"text\\\" ><p>In addition to being consistent in your earnings call schedule, you want to be sure you have conferencing technology that works consistently well, and in your control. When you are outsourcing your calls to an operator-assisted conferencing center, you may have a great experience - and you may not. If they don\'t have the right infrastructure and you get a lot of interested parties showing up for the earnings release call, some calls may get dropped or have bad audio quality. Worse? The entire call is disconnected because of the overload - and no one is hearing your results. It then won\'t matter if your numbers were good or bad - you are out of compliance and will hear about it from regulators and the marketplace.<\\/p><p>With an up-to-date conferencing platform, you:<\\/p><ul><li>Know who is speaking and when.<\\/li><li>Can capture and respond to written questions from those who may have a hearing or speech challenge<\\/li><li>Make it easy for participants to attend how they prefer - via a call-in number or through online link utilizing computer headset\\/VOIP. <\\/li><li>Can record the call for easy sharing to your site&nbsp;following the call. <\\/li><li>Easily embed in your site with your branding. Reaffirming your company\'s image with your own system that reflects your style and branding guidelines is one more way to enhance your image with potential and current investors.<\\/li><\\/ul><p>More importantly, have it be comfortable for your CFO and IR team to use without relearning every time.<\\/p><p>A nice side benefit - this type of system can also be utilized for other needs in the company with clients, prospects and staff.<\\/p><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"heading\\\" ><h2><p>Practice, practice, practice for your&nbsp;best earnings release&nbsp;call<\\/p><\\/h2><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"text\\\" ><p>It\'s not only the way to Carnegie Hall - it\'s also the way to be sure you eliminate the risk of having a rocky earnings release&nbsp;call due to technology or losing your message when challenged. Whether you are a CFO doing this for the first time or the 25th - and no matter what results you are delivering - practicing the actual call should be standard. Run it from beginning to end at least once. Practice with the technical aspects of the conferencing system; delivering your message; and, handling the off-kilter: people who submit written questions or questions outside what you\'ve practiced. You can use this opportunity to work out the kinks of the tech. It\'s also a great way to practice when you get an out there question - how to address with a pivot and leveraging your message.<\\/p>\\n<p><span>Consistency in your communication logistics, the technology and the practice - these are the keys to the delivery of a successful earnings call.<\\/span>&nbsp;<\\/p><\\/div>\",\"intro\":\"For your quarterly earnings release call, your CFO and investor relations (IR) team work diligently to prepare.

If one of these things goes wrong, at best it is a momentary hiccup during the call; at worst, you fail to comply with one of the regulatory requirements (Sarbanes-Oxley, Regulation FD, etc.) or the marketplace misunderstands and dings your stock price. <\\\\\\/p>\\\\n<p><span>In addition to planning for the content of your call, here are some best practices you can leverage to insure your overall call is a success.<\\\\\\/span>&nbsp;<\\\\\\/p>\\\\t\\\\t<\\\\\\/div><\\\\\\/div>\\\\t\\\\t\\\"},{\\\"uid\\\":\\\"003060662807170389\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"heading\\\",\\\"html\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<h2>Scheduling and announcing your earnings release call<\\\\\\/h2>\\\\t\\\\t\\\",\\\"data\\\":{\\\"level\\\":\\\"H2\\\"},\\\"blocks\\\":[],\\\"nested\\\":false,\\\"isolated\\\":false,\\\"text\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tScheduling and announcing your earnings release call\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tDrag to move this block\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\u00a0 Duplicate\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\u00a0 Move\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\u00a0 Remove\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\",\\\"editableHtml\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<h2 contenteditable=\\\\\\\"true\\\\\\\">Scheduling and announcing your earnings release call<\\\\\\/h2>\\\\t\\\\t\\\"},{\\\"uid\\\":\\\"018541453644060013\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"text\\\",\\\"html\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<p>This is a required call - and you are obligated to announce it in advance to the public.

We started using Horn, and week by week, new features were being released that were revolutionizing how people meet online. Lawrence was leading a change to fix a broken industry, and I simply *had* to be involved. It was a product that *finally* fixed a problem that we\'ve consistently struggled with. In terms of other products, our company has simply used them all: WebEx, GoToMeeting, Fuze, UberConference, Join.me, AnyMeeting, Google Hangouts, Skype, Zoom, and the list could go on and on.<\\/span><\\/p>\\n<p>For the sake of this article, we\'ll focus on three formidable solutions - Zoom, Skype and Horn - and why Horn supersedes them all, especially in 4 main areas:<\\/p>\\n<ol><li>Brand Continuity<\\/li><li>Ease of Use<\\/li><li>Quality<\\/li><li>Moderation<\\/li><\\/ol><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"heading\\\" ><h3>Zoom vs. Skype vs. Horn: Brand Continuity<\\/h3><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"text\\\" ><p><span>Organizations spend big bucks to ensure their brand is consistent.

If you\'re able to meet on your organization\'s website via an embeddable widget, you\'re doing several things.<\\/span><\\/p>\\n<ol><li>You\'re able to cross market other products\\/ services in a sidebar.<\\/li><li>You\'re keeping them on-brand.<\\/li><li>You\'re keeping them on your site.<\\/li><li>It\'s good for SEO.<\\/li><\\/ol>\\n<p>Skype doesn\'t have this and neither does Zoom. It\'s a feature that all web conferencing platforms should have, and it\'s a hindrance to any company not fully taking advantage of this. From a business owner\'s perspective, it\'s so important to get quality leads in the door, so having the ability to manage the entire end-to-end experience from the point of lead inception to the initial sales call is imperative. Horn makes this happen.<\\/p><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"heading\\\" ><h3><br><p>Zoom vs. Skype vs. Horn: Ease<\\/p><\\/h3><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"text\\\" ><p>\\u200b<span>We\'re all dealing with a loaded technology stack with differing levels of complexity and learning curves.

You can start a meeting from multiple sources: Google Calendar; from their app; from the Zoom site; and, it can be extremely confusing for someone to keep track of everything they offer. At the end of the day, all I want to do is quickly setup a meeting and have it happen mellifluously and smoothly.<\\/p>\\n<p>With Horn, no downloads are necessary; saving time, resources, and therefore, money. <\\/p>\\n<p>Skype requires a download, and with it\'s ever-changing navigation, people are confused on what does what. <\\/p>\\n<p>Easy.

We went through the exercise of each people muting their audio to determine the culprit, and precious meeting minutes were lost and people were frustrated.<\\/p><p>So we ended up switching to Skype, and similar issues ensued. With Horn, the audio quality is impeccable. Take it for a test drive yourself, and see. (link to demo).<\\/p><p>In some large meetings such as earnings release calls (link to article), poor audio quality could end up in next day\'s headlines. Investing in top-notch quality is an absolute must.<\\/p><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"heading\\\" ><h3><br><p>Zoom vs. Skype vs. Horn: Moderation<\\/p><\\/h3><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"text\\\" ><p>In the above scenario that was generated by poor audio quality, it would have been invaluable to know who the \'bad audio bandit\' was so we could mute them. This brings us to moderation. How can we mute an attendee if their audio is diminishing the overall quality of the meeting? How can we quickly assign certain privileges such as screen sharing or \'presenter roles\' on the fly and on a whim?<\\/p><p>While Skype\'s moderation tools are lacking, Zoom\'s tools are frankly quite powerful. However, if they aren\'t easy and\\/ or accessible to the user, then it\'s a bit for naught.

In terms of other products, our company has simply used them all: WebEx, GoToMeeting, Fuze, UberConference, Join.me, AnyMeeting, Google Hangouts, Skype, Zoom, and the list could go on and on.<\\\\\\/span><\\\\\\/p>\\\\n<p>For the sake of this article, we\'ll focus on three formidable solutions - Zoom, Skype and Horn - and why Horn supersedes them all, especially in 4 main areas:<\\\\\\/p>\\\\n<ol><li>Brand Continuity<\\\\\\/li><li>Ease of Use<\\\\\\/li><li>Quality<\\\\\\/li><li>Moderation<\\\\\\/li><\\\\\\/ol>\\\\t\\\\t<\\\\\\/div><\\\\\\/div>\\\\t\\\\t\\\"},{\\\"uid\\\":\\\"07567466297509184\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"heading\\\",\\\"html\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<h3>Zoom vs. Skype vs. Horn: Brand Continuity<\\\\\\/h3>\\\\t\\\\t\\\",\\\"data\\\":{\\\"level\\\":\\\"H2\\\"},\\\"blocks\\\":[],\\\"nested\\\":false,\\\"isolated\\\":false,\\\"text\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tZoom vs. Skype vs. Horn: Brand Continuity\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tDrag to move this block\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\u00a0 Duplicate\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\u00a0 Move\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\u00a0 Remove\\\\t\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\",\\\"editableHtml\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<h3 contenteditable=\\\\\\\"true\\\\\\\">Zoom vs. Skype vs. Horn: Brand Continuity<\\\\\\/h3>\\\\t\\\\t\\\"},{\\\"uid\\\":\\\"05696009286710906\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"text\\\",\\\"html\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<p><span>Organizations spend big bucks to ensure their brand is consistent.

By building an online community that provides them with an opportunity to engage in deeper and more meaningful ways. What does it take? A flexible infrastructure that adapts and supports your needs - and a plan for how to approach. In this article, we\'ll look at some things you should consider for your community - and some ideas for how to use them when you do create your community online.&nbsp;<\\/p><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"heading\\\" ><h3>\\n\\t<span>Picking a platform for building your online community<span class=\\\"redactor-invisible-space\\\">\\u200b<\\/span><span class=\\\"redactor-invisible-space\\\"><\\/span><\\/span>\\n<\\/h3><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"text\\\" ><p>We\'ve all seen them or have them - \\\"online communities\\\" that are long discussion strings of written conversations moderated by a community leader or designated subject matter expert. Creating a community online with a set of written discussion strings or forum is a start - but it is only the beginning. More capabilities can provide more opportunities for individuals or groups to connect.<\\/p><p>For example:<\\/p><ul><li>video or audio chats among your members and\\/or a moderator and a specific set of members<\\/li><li>real-time collaboration on a project sharing screens and files<\\/li><li>hosting a special guest or panel of guests in a live presentation<\\/li><li>providing a recorded series of podcasts or webinars<\\/li><\\/ul><p>Those are things that your platform should support to provide flexibility to your community members, leaders and event moderators. <\\/p><p>Behind the scenes, it should also make it easy on your IT team, infrastructure and budget:<\\/p><ul><li>allow you to quickly embed the functionality in your website.<\\/li><li>be white-labelled - aka: flexible enough to easily add your organization\'s \\\"look and feel\\\" to your new community, reinforcing your branding with participants.<\\/li><li>integrate easily with your other tech (have an open API).<\\/li><li>enable you to make security as tight as needed.<\\/li><li>scale up effectively, efficiently and cost-effectively, whether you grow from 1 to 100 - or 10k+ community members - without eating up bandwidth. <\\/li><\\/ul><p>So if you\'ve picked your platform, let\'s talk about ideas for putting it to work for your community.<\\/p><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"heading\\\" ><h3>Engaging your online community<\\/h3><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"text\\\" ><p>Supportive tech is great - now you really need ideas for your potential member audiences. What will make them sit up and take notice - and more importantly - join and participate? Well, in the case of The MIDI Association (midi.org), when they started their online community for MIDI users - folks who use the MIDI technology to create and share music and sound - they had just a handful of members. Through great content: recordings from industry events; moderated panel discussions of experts on topics of member interest; and hosted interactive events; plus targeted newsletters, nurturing emails and special opportunities, they attracted 15,000 (and counting) more new members! And this all volunteer organization was able to do this easily with horn as the platform for their community (which allowed them to quickly integrate right into their website in a sidebar on their existing member forum with their own branding) and a plan for identifying and rolling out the communications. <\\/p><p>What about more restrictive or exclusive communities? If you are building an online community for an institution or entity where you need to maintain more control over who accesses which content - and\\/or which \\\"event\\\" the member is invited to participate in - you can use your online community not only for the general, but also specific needs. For example, online communities for:<\\/p><ul><li>An institution of higher education - a college, university or conservatory: You want to grow your reach, while targeting content and access by group. Your current students are used to having an online life and you may already have a \\\"campus-wide\\\" online community - but does it support how your students, faculty or even alum may want to interact? What about those who are from the general area that like to stay engaged with their neighbors on campus? <\\/li><\\/ul><p>Establishing a general community for all your constituents is first step. For students and faculty, you can leverage a current sign-on or username they may have been issued to allow them access (so they don\'t have to remember a different one - making it easy for them to participate). For \\\"neighbors,\\\" have them log in with their Facebook or Google. Use the community to post your updates about things that everyone loves: schedules for your sports and performances; overall calendar for academic year; good news about students, faculty and alum; etc. Then take advantage of the functionality of your platform and establish different groups within that: invite your divisions, departments, schools and centers of excellence to create targeted events and conversations which are only open to specific participants - undergrads OR grad students OR majors of a discipline, for example; have faculty members utilize for their \\\"office hours\\\" via video chat or to have their students in a particular course collaborate on an \\\"all-hands on deck\\\" project with live chat and sharing documents; letting upper-level course students set up smaller study groups with video, voice and sharing documents; etc. By creating a centralized community - one single place where many things happen, but appropriate for the audience - you can grow your institution\'s community.<\\/p><ul><li>For a sports team or performing artist\\/band: You want to grow your reach, but also make your community members feel like they are part of an exclusive club. Making it easy for folks to join your community online with their Facebook or other social media credentials is important - and then providing \\\"members only\\\" content: recordings of your well-known players\\/ performers speaking to the members about what happens \\\"behind the scenes\\\" during practice; hosted panel discussions with the stars about what is in the plans for the upcoming season or tour; etc. And providing fans opportunities to interact in an online moderated chat with a favorite and share their love of all things you are in a regularly scheduled \\\"were you there?!?\\\" post-event chats.
