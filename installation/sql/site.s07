Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator, unless the claim amount exceeds $1 Million United States Dollars, in which case the dispute shall be heard by a panel of three arbitrators. In arbitrations having one arbitrator, the arbitrator will be selected by the AAA. In arbitrations with three arbitrators, within fifteen (15) days after the commencement of arbitration, each party shall select one person to act as arbitrator and the two selected shall select a third arbitrator within ten days of their appointment. If the arbitrators selected by the parties are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA. The place of arbitration shall be Charlottesville, Virginia, United States, and the arbitration shall be conducted in English. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the applicable federal laws of the United States. The arbitrator(s) will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party\'s actual damages, except as may be required by applicable laws. The arbitrator(s) may award injunctive relief for infringement of Intellectual Property Rights or any violation of the Acceptable Use Policy. The arbitrator(s) shall not award consequential, punitive, special, or exemplary damages in any arbitration initiated under this Section\\u00a017.2.
