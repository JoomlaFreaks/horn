What will make them sit up and take notice - and more importantly - join and participate? Well, in the case of The MIDI Association (midi.org), when they started their online community for MIDI users - folks who use the MIDI technology to create and share music and sound - they had just a handful of members. Through great content: recordings from industry events; moderated panel discussions of experts on topics of member interest; and hosted interactive events; plus targeted newsletters, nurturing emails and special opportunities, they attracted 15,000 (and counting) more new members! And this all volunteer organization was able to do this easily with horn as the platform for their community (which allowed them to quickly integrate right into their website in a sidebar on their existing member forum with their own branding) and a plan for identifying and rolling out the communications. </p><p>What about more restrictive or exclusive communities? If you are building an online community for an institution or entity where you need to maintain more control over who accesses which content - and/or which \"event\" the member is invited to participate in - you can use your online community not only for the general, but also specific needs. For example, online communities for:</p><ul><li>An institution of higher education - a college, university or conservatory: You want to grow your reach, while targeting content and access by group. Your current students are used to having an online life and you may already have a \"campus-wide\" online community - but does it support how your students, faculty or even alum may want to interact? What about those who are from the general area that like to stay engaged with their neighbors on campus? </li></ul><p>Establishing a general community for all your constituents is first step. For students and faculty, you can leverage a current sign-on or username they may have been issued to allow them access (so they don\'t have to remember a different one - making it easy for them to participate). For \"neighbors,\" have them log in with their Facebook or Google. Use the community to post your updates about things that everyone loves: schedules for your sports and performances; overall calendar for academic year; good news about students, faculty and alum; etc. Then take advantage of the functionality of your platform and establish different groups within that: invite your divisions, departments, schools and centers of excellence to create targeted events and conversations which are only open to specific participants - undergrads OR grad students OR majors of a discipline, for example; have faculty members utilize for their \"office hours\" via video chat or to have their students in a particular course collaborate on an \"all-hands on deck\" project with live chat and sharing documents; letting upper-level course students set up smaller study groups with video, voice and sharing documents; etc. By creating a centralized community - one single place where many things happen, but appropriate for the audience - you can grow your institution\'s community.</p><ul><li>For a sports team or performing artist/band: You want to grow your reach, but also make your community members feel like they are part of an exclusive club. Making it easy for folks to join your community online with their Facebook or other social media credentials is important - and then providing \"members only\" content: recordings of your well-known players/ performers speaking to the members about what happens \"behind the scenes\" during practice; hosted panel discussions with the stars about what is in the plans for the upcoming season or tour; etc. And providing fans opportunities to interact in an online moderated chat with a favorite and share their love of all things you are in a regularly scheduled \"were you there?!?\" post-event chats. Making it easy to join and participate - while making them feel special with \"insider info\" is one of the best ways to make this group grow.</li></ul><ul><li>For healthcare institutions - to both grow engagement with the general public, while creating secure internal collaboration: Creating a community of wellness for your physical community, including staff, potential patients and neighbors, allows you to share educational opportunities through recorded content on everything from tips on eating well to exercise ideas for seniors. Being able to establish logins that easily distinguish between general public and medical staff allows you to then have dedicated and secure areas that allow your staff to have private conversations and share ideas or host \"virtual\" in-service events for staff via video that can also be recorded for those who couldn\'t attend - and at a glance, see who has participated. Openness for the general group - making it easy to access and consume - while providing secure collaboration is key for encouraging use.</li></ul><p>Establish your goals, identify your audiences and what they want from you most - and pair with great community platform to build a successful online community!</p></div>', NULL, '1', '1', '0', '2018-02-26 20:37:33', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0', '0', '6', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, 'post:8/building-an-online-community.jpg', '{\"images\":[],\"videos\":[],\"audios\":[],\"galleries\":[],\"pdf\":[]}', '', '0', '0', '30', '0', 'easyblog.sitewide', '67.165.173.183', 'ebd', '{\"type\":\"ebd\",\"blocks\":[{\"uid\":\"043178384749825804\",\"type\":\"text\",\"html\":\"\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>How can you help your customers, students, members and other stakeholders truly connect with you and each other - whether they are physically close or scattered across geography and time zones?

And this gets more complicated when you are part of a panel of presenters. It\'s hard enough when your audience is in the same room, but what happens when presenters and audience are all in different locations and you need to deliver via video conferencing? This adds an additional layer of logistics and session management that can feel daunting - but don\'t worry, there are some things you can do to make this a presentation to be proud of. <\\/p><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"heading\\\" ><h2>\\n\\t<span>Video conferencing technology that works for you<span class=\\\"redactor-invisible-space\\\">\\u200b<\\/span><\\/span>\\n<\\/h2><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"text\\\" ><p>When everyone is in the same room, there are no questions around who is speaking when or who is in the audience. You control access to the room and can more easily pass the baton from presenter to presenter with a word, a nod or literally handing them a microphone. What happens when you are geographically scattered? You need to rely on your technology to support:<\\/p>\\n<ul><li>Controlling access to the video conference session. You want your invited guests there - no more, and no less. Unfortunately, some conferencing systems, like join.me, use the same online meeting room for every one of your meetings - so once someone has been to one of your video conferences, web meeting or conference call, they know your meeting room address. This may be fine if you are manually \\\"allowing\\\" each attendee in one at a time - but if you have 20 invited guests, you might be tempted to just \\\"unlock\\\" the meeting - and there goes your control. If you have different back-to-back sessions planned, how ugly could it be if you are VP of HR rolling out the benefits to different groups of workers - exempt staff at 1pm and the unionized staff at 2pm - and someone dials in at the wrong time? You also won\'t have any way of knowing who actually attended. Without the lock on the meeting, the attendees aren\'t logged into the system in any tangible way. With horn, you can easily host a secure session where only those with invitations can access - and your next session can be in a separate \\\"meeting room\\\" that you can switch into with just a couple of clicks.<\\/li><li>Controlling who is seen and heard. Having a video conference with many attendees and multiple presenters in disparate locations - potentially even across the globe - requires technology that can support you in identifying who is who - and giving each group specific rights. Say you want your presenters to be able to speak and be seen via video at all times, broadcasting the presentation to the audience. The audience should be able to see and hear, but not chime in to ask questions until you open up the floor for audio. Zoom\'s webinar meetings can do this - but it is separately licensed and priced (higher) than their standard meeting software.<\\/li><li>All your video conferencing needs - and more. Many organizations have an array of technology licenses to address their various online meeting, voice conferencing and broadcasting needs. It\'s not unusual to see the see one paying for join.me, Zoom, and GoToWebinar at the same time - wracking up lots of cost and still having unhappy users. Having a flexible system like horn, you can use whether you\'re holding a video conference for 10 or 100 - and can also leverage for your other web and voice meeting needs. This can run the gamut from live and recorded broadcasts to using in your tech support or customer service calls to internal project meetings. One platform that meets wider needs lets your team be comfortable with a single, feature rich tech - and is a much more cost-effective and flexible approach for most businesses.<\\/li><li>Continuing to enhance and reflect your brand. It\'s nice when you can have your internal folks using a video conferencing system that reflects your brand\'s usual \\\"look and feel.\\\" It\'s imperative for prospective and current clients that your brand moves seamlessly through all your embedded technology for interactions and communications, including video conferencing platform. So ask about \\\"white labelling\\\" and customizing the interface for your organization with any potential provider.<\\/li><\\/ul><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"heading\\\" ><h2>The best video conferencing tech can\'t help unless\\u2026<\\/h2><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"text\\\" ><p>Great tech is a huge part of a successful presentation delivered via video conferencing - it\'s not the only thing. You still need to be prepared and practice certain habits that will make it rock:<\\/p>\\n<ul><li>Personal preparation. If you work in an open floor plan or your office is in a noisy area, you\'ll want to identify and reserve a quiet location to broadcast from. In addition to making sure it is quiet, you\'ll also want to test the audio and video ahead of your meeting day. Do a short recording and play it back. Is it truly quiet - or are you so used to the traffic noise from below you don\'t notice it anymore? What is behind you on the video? Is it a lot of visual \\\"noise\\\" - or worse - something that could be \\\"corporate secrets\\\" or considered inappropriate by the audience? And are you looking right into the camera on your screen - or are they looking at the top of your head as you look down at your notes on the desk while you mumble? You want to be looking directly into the camera, speaking clearly - loud enough but not shouting - and have a neutral environment.<\\/li><li>Panel preparation. Share with your other presenters the \\\"tips and tricks\\\" that you are employing for ensuring a good location for the video conference - quiet, good visuals etc. Provide them with the agenda\\/flow of events you\'ve planned and confirm that everyone is on the same page. You\'ll also want to invite to be presenters and share specific instructions for accessing the video conferencing system.<\\/li><li>Tech practice. Practice launching the different stages of the video conference with one or more of the other presenters (it\'s great when all can do a \\\"dress rehearsal\' but not always practical or possible). Document the elements\\/details and share with the other presenters, along with the agenda. If you are using something like horn, one time through and you should feel comfortable to go!<\\/li><\\/ul>\\n<p><span>Pairing your well-planned content with great tech and overall preparation can make for a successful presentation via video conferencing!<\\/span>&nbsp;<\\/p><\\/div>\",\"intro\":\"\\u200bPutting together a good presentation can be nerve wracking - you are juggling so many elements - from your slide show to the way you stand to being sure your messages resonate.

You want your invited guests there - no more, and no less. Unfortunately, some conferencing systems, like join.me, use the same online meeting room for every one of your meetings - so once someone has been to one of your video conferences, web meeting or conference call, they know your meeting room address. This may be fine if you are manually \\\\\\\"allowing\\\\\\\" each attendee in one at a time - but if you have 20 invited guests, you might be tempted to just \\\\\\\"unlock\\\\\\\" the meeting - and there goes your control. If you have different back-to-back sessions planned, how ugly could it be if you are VP of HR rolling out the benefits to different groups of workers - exempt staff at 1pm and the unionized staff at 2pm - and someone dials in at the wrong time? You also won\'t have any way of knowing who actually attended. Without the lock on the meeting, the attendees aren\'t logged into the system in any tangible way. With horn, you can easily host a secure session where only those with invitations can access - and your next session can be in a separate \\\\\\\"meeting room\\\\\\\" that you can switch into with just a couple of clicks.<\\\\\\/li><li>Controlling who is seen and heard. Having a video conference with many attendees and multiple presenters in disparate locations - potentially even across the globe - requires technology that can support you in identifying who is who - and giving each group specific rights. Say you want your presenters to be able to speak and be seen via video at all times, broadcasting the presentation to the audience. The audience should be able to see and hear, but not chime in to ask questions until you open up the floor for audio. Zoom\'s webinar meetings can do this - but it is separately licensed and priced (higher) than their standard meeting software.<\\\\\\/li><li>All your video conferencing needs - and more. Many organizations have an array of technology licenses to address their various online meeting, voice conferencing and broadcasting needs. It\'s not unusual to see the see one paying for join.me, Zoom, and GoToWebinar at the same time - wracking up lots of cost and still having unhappy users. Having a flexible system like horn, you can use whether you\'re holding a video conference for 10 or 100 - and can also leverage for your other web and voice meeting needs. This can run the gamut from live and recorded broadcasts to using in your tech support or customer service calls to internal project meetings.

From building the annual plan to establishing the themes and messages to positioning the fiscal period results in relationship to that plan and the street\'s expectations - your team knows what is at stake and wants to be ready to have your messages communicated effectively for this important call. <\\/p>\\n<p>But knowing what you plan to say and delivering a successful call are not always the same thing. There are a whole host of things that can go wrong - from logistical to technical - that can derail your call. If one of these things goes wrong, at best it is a momentary hiccup during the call; at worst, you fail to comply with one of the regulatory requirements (Sarbanes-Oxley, Regulation FD, etc.) or the marketplace misunderstands and dings your stock price. <\\/p>\\n<p><span>In addition to planning for the content of your call, here are some best practices you can leverage to insure your overall call is a success.<\\/span>&nbsp;<\\/p><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"heading\\\" ><h2>Scheduling and announcing your earnings release call<\\/h2><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"text\\\" ><p>This is a required call - and you are obligated to announce it in advance to the public. In that announcement you\'ll include not only time and date, but the call-in info for the actual earnings release&nbsp;call. Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD) requires you announce the information to everyone at the same time - and yes, posting the announcement to your website meets that requirement. On the other hand, the SEC\'s Exchange Act Form 8-K requires a press release - so yes, you\'ll want to do that too. <\\/p>\\n<p>But what about other methods, like posting to social media or email blasts to your contact list? And when should you announce? These are more flexible and your decisions should be made in light of your overall IR strategy. Some ideas\\/recommendations:<\\/p>\\n<ul><li>Plan to release at same time of quarter\\/day of week. Having a consistent schedule for rolling out your earnings report and call helps neutralize the guessing game of analysts or media play about whether your numbers are going to meet expectations. If you do it at different times each quarter, you may inadvertently be broadcasting in advance your results. On good quarters, you may want to release numbers sooner and earlier in the week. For tougher quarters, later and on Thursday. Even if you aren\'t that blatant, your scheduling pattern may reveal more than you think. This consistency also simplifies it for your internal team for logistics and planning. <\\/li><li>Have a consistent time in advance of the call to announce. Having a consistent time each quarter for your call is one thing - announcing the date of that call is the other element that should be consistent. Most companies do it somewhere between one and three weeks before the call. Pick your standard - and incorporate into your IR annual plan so that it doesn\'t creep up on you. Again, the more consistent these types of elements, the less likely they are to inadvertently color expectations.<\\/li><li>Utilize social media and other digital pathways to spread the news. Your next generation of potential investors may or may not visit your website in time to see the announcement - and may never see a press release. Concurrently announcing via social media - along with your required pathways - can help enhance the awareness in your future investors where they spend the most time online.<\\/li><\\/ul><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"heading\\\" ><h2>Utilize an earnings call system you control<\\/h2><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"text\\\" ><p>In addition to being consistent in your earnings call schedule, you want to be sure you have conferencing technology that works consistently well, and in your control. When you are outsourcing your calls to an operator-assisted conferencing center, you may have a great experience - and you may not. If they don\'t have the right infrastructure and you get a lot of interested parties showing up for the earnings release call, some calls may get dropped or have bad audio quality. Worse? The entire call is disconnected because of the overload - and no one is hearing your results. It then won\'t matter if your numbers were good or bad - you are out of compliance and will hear about it from regulators and the marketplace.<\\/p><p>With an up-to-date conferencing platform, you:<\\/p><ul><li>Know who is speaking and when.<\\/li><li>Can capture and respond to written questions from those who may have a hearing or speech challenge<\\/li><li>Make it easy for participants to attend how they prefer - via a call-in number or through online link utilizing computer headset\\/VOIP. <\\/li><li>Can record the call for easy sharing to your site for the couple of weeks following the call. <\\/li><li>Easily embed in your site with your branding. Reaffirming your company\'s image with your own system that reflects your style and branding guidelines is one more way to enhance your image with potential and current investors.<\\/li><\\/ul><p>More importantly, have it be comfortable for your CFO and IR team to use without relearning every time.<\\/p><p>A nice side benefit - this type of system can also be utilized for other needs in the company with clients, prospects and staff.<\\/p><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"heading\\\" ><h2><p>Practice, practice, practice for your&nbsp;best earnings release&nbsp;call<\\/p><\\/h2><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"text\\\" ><p>It\'s not only the way to Carnegie Hall - it\'s also the way to be sure you eliminate the risk of having a rocky earnings release&nbsp;call due to technology or losing your message when challenged. Whether you are a CFO doing this for the first time or the 25th - and no matter what results you are delivering - practicing the actual call should be standard. Run it from beginning to end at least once. Practice with the technical aspects of the conferencing system; delivering your message; and, handling the off-kilter: people who submit written questions or questions outside what you\'ve practiced.

And this gets more complicated when you are part of a panel of presenters. It\'s hard enough when your audience is in the same room, but what happens when presenters and audience are all in different locations and you need to deliver via video conferencing? This adds an additional layer of logistics and session management that can feel daunting - but don\'t worry, there are some things you can do to make this a presentation to be proud of. <\\/p><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"heading\\\" ><h2>\\n\\t<span>Video conferencing technology that works for you<span class=\\\"redactor-invisible-space\\\">\\u200b<\\/span><\\/span>\\n<\\/h2><\\/div><div class=\\\"ebd-block  \\\" data-type=\\\"text\\\" ><p>When everyone is in the same room, there are no questions around who is speaking when or who is in the audience. You control access to the room and can more easily pass the baton from presenter to presenter with a word, a nod or literally handing them a microphone. What happens when you are geographically scattered? You need to rely on your technology to support:<\\/p>\\n<ul><li>Controlling access to the video conference session. You want your invited guests there - no more, and no less. Unfortunately, some conferencing systems, like join.me, use the same online meeting room for every one of your meetings - so once someone has been to one of your video conferences, web meeting or conference call, they know your meeting room address. This may be fine if you are manually \\\"allowing\\\" each attendee in one at a time - but if you have 20 invited guests, you might be tempted to just \\\"unlock\\\" the meeting - and there goes your control. If you have different back-to-back sessions planned, how ugly could it be if you are VP of HR rolling out the benefits to different groups of workers - exempt staff at 1pm and the unionized staff at 2pm - and someone dials in at the wrong time? You also won\'t have any way of knowing who actually attended. Without the lock on the meeting, the attendees aren\'t logged into the system in any tangible way. With horn, you can easily host a secure session where only those with invitations can access - and your next session can be in a separate \\\"meeting room\\\" that you can switch into with just a couple of clicks.<\\/li><li>Controlling who is seen and heard. Having a video conference with many attendees and multiple presenters in disparate locations - potentially even across the globe - requires technology that can support you in identifying who is who - and giving each group specific rights.
